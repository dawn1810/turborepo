# @repo/tailwind-config

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- # UI Button Component Enhancement

  ## BREAKING CHANGES

  - Updated the Button component in `@repo/ui` to include a new `disabled` prop
  - Changed primary variant colors from blue-500/green to blue-600/white for better contrast

  ## WHY

  - The disabled state is a common requirement for buttons in web applications
  - The color scheme has been adjusted to meet accessibility standards

  ## HOW TO UPDATE

  - If you're using the Button component, check if you need to handle the new disabled state
  - Verify that the new color scheme works with your existing UI design
